OAuth (short for Open Authorization) is a standard authorization protocol that allows third-party applications to access a user’s resources without exposing their login credentials. It’s commonly used for logins via services like Google, Facebook, or GitHub.

Key Concepts of OAuth:
	•	Resource Owner: The user who owns the data.
	•	Client: The application requesting access.
	•	Authorization Server: Authenticates the user and issues access tokens (e.g., Google, Facebook).
	•	Resource Server: The server hosting the protected resources (e.g., an API).
	•	Access Token: A credential used by the client to access protected resources.

OAuth Flow (Authorization Code Grant - most common):
	1.	User Clicks “Login with X”: Redirects to the authorization server.
	2.	User Logs In and Approves Access: The server asks the user to authorize the client.
	3.	Redirect with Authorization Code: The client gets a temporary code.
	4.	Exchange Code for Token: The client sends the code to the server to get an access token.
	5.	Access Protected Resources: The token is used to call the resource server.

There are other flows too, like Client Credentials, Implicit, and Device Authorization, depending on the use case.
